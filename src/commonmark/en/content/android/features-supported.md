# Features supported

The following is a comprehensive list of all features available for Programs with and without registration in DHIS2, and notes on whether or not these have been implemented in the Android Capture app.

In the notes, ‘admin’ refers to someone who develops and configures a DHIS2 system, and ‘user’ refers to someone who uses apps to capture data, update it, and review reports.

## Program features
|Feature|Description of feature|Program with registration|Program without registration|Notes on implementation|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Data entry method for option sets|Enables an admin to choose how options will be displayed on-screen across the entire program (ie either as drop-down lists or as radio buttons)|&ndash;|&ndash;|This will be replaced by the new rendering options.|
|Combination of categories<br />(Attribute CatCombo)|Allows an admin to attach a Category (set of Options) to the Program, requiring users to categorize each enrolment. (This is called an Attribute Category Combination in DHIS2.)|✓|✓||
|Data approval workflow|If an admin selects a pre-configured Data Approval Workflow, this will be used to enforce an &lsquo;approval&rsquo; or &lsquo;acceptance and approval&rsquo; cascade, enabling users to sign-off and lock data.|&ndash;|&ndash;||
|Display front page list|If this option is ticked, the landing page displays a list of active enrolments once an Org Unit and Program have been chosen. (Attributes shown are those ticked as &lsquo;display in list&rsquo;.)|✓|n/a||
|First stage appears on registration page|When this option is chosen, then during Program enrolment, the screen for the first Program Stage is also shown (enrolment and the first event are captured together on one screen).|✓|n/a| In Android, this is implemented by opening automatically the event after enrollment is completed, instead of adding the form to the same screen.|
|Completed events expiry days|Enables admins to lock data-entry a certain number of days after an event has been completed.|✓|✓||
|Expiry period type + expiry days|Enables admins to set a period (eg weekly, monthly), and to lock data-entry a certain number of days after the end of the period.|✓|✓||
|Allow future enrolment dates|If ticked, this enables a user to enter future Enrolment dates during enrolment in a Program; otherwise users are restricted to today or past dates.|✓|n/a||
